# Fit Quest 
Fit Quest is a gamified workout app focused on helping users complete short, daily workouts through a fun adventure theme. Users have a hero character that levels up as they complete workouts, unlock new exercises, and earn rewards. The goal is to make exercise less intimidating and more engaging with small, achievable fitness tasks.

## **How It Works**

### **Background Music**
- Background music starts from the splash screen and continues playing across the app.
- The music is "Hinoki Wood" by Gia Margaret or you know it as "Chill Guy Meme."
- Managed by the `BGMPlayer` utility, allowing for:
  - Looping playback.
  - Continuous playback across all screens.

### **Quests**
- Complete **Daily Quest** and **Repeatable Quests** to earn:
  - **EXP**: Increases your hero’s level.
  - **Gold**: Used to purchase character images or backgrounds.
- Quest difficulties provide different **EXP** and **gold** rewards.

### **Shop**
- Spend **gold** in the shop to unlock:
  - **Character Images**: Customize the look of your hero.
  - **Backgrounds**: Personalize your background appearance.
- Purchased items can be equipped directly from the profile screen.
